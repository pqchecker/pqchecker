pqchecker.so shared library  for OpneLDAP/pPolicy overlay
Allows checks of passwords content quality
version 2.0.0
---------------------------------------------------------

pqChecker is a plug-in for OpenLDAP directory server with ppolicy overlay.
It allows to control the quality of the password before storing it in the 
dedicated directory attribute. If the password mets configured parameters, 
it is accepted. It is rejected otherwise.

The controlled parameters are: 
. Number of required uppercase characters.
. Number of required lowercase characters.
. Number of required special characters.
. Number of required digits.
. List of forbidden characters.

pqChecker allows, also, an easy settings management by providing two functions 
for reading and modifying them.

 bool set_params(char *params, char *fmt);
 bool get_params(char *params, char *fmt);

Also allows to broadcast the changed password in real time.
This feature is configurable (cf. Configuration parameter in the manual page)
and requires the installation of pqMessenger middleware.
